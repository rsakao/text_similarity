  'snippet': 'I always called him "sensei" (teacher). So even here, I only write 'sensei' and don't tell him my real name. This is to avoid any publicity.
             I call him "Sensei" because it is more natural for me to do so, rather than because I am afraid of being seen by the world. I write every time I recall the person's memory', 'url': '', ''.
